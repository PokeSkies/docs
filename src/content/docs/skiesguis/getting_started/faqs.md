description: Frequently asked questions about the SkiesGUIs mod
---

Due to the potential complexity of this mod, there are some frequent issues and questions that may arise when using SkiesGUIs. Below are some of the most common questions and their answers:

### Player Heads
**Q:** How do I set a player head as an item in my GUI?

**A:** Player Heads can be set using the special keyword `playerhead` followed by an option specifier. See the [Player Heads](/skiesguis/gui_config/items/#player-heads) section in Supported Materials for more information on available playerhead item specifiers.

### Custom GUI Textures
**Q:** How can I add custom GUI textures to my GUIs?

**A:** This can be done a few ways, but the most common method is to use a Resource Pack that overrides an unused font character with a custom texture. You then can use that overriden font character in the title of the GUI. You may need to adjust the horizontal and vertical alignment using a Negative Space Font Character and the fon character's vertical offset.
