title: Base Configuration
description: Guide to configure GUIs for the SkiesGUIs mod
---

import { FileTree } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Each GUI configuration is stored in its own JSON file within the `guis` folder inside the main `/config/skiesguis/` folder.
<FileTree>
- config
    - skiesguis
        - guis
            - example_gui.json
            - second_gui.json
</FileTree>

Every GUI can have a base set of configuration options defined. Most importantly, the `"title"`, `"size"`, and `"items"` options are necessary for most use cases. Additional options can be defined for added functionality.
```json
{
  "title": "<dark_gray>Example GUI",
  "size": 3,
  "alias_commands": [],
  "alias_permission": "",
  "open_actions": {},
  "close_actions": {},
  "open_requirements": {},
  "items": {}
}
```

### Title (required)
The message displayed at the top of the GUI. Uses [MiniMessage formatting](https://docs.advntr.dev/minimessage/format.html)!
```json
"title": "<dark_gray>Example Title"
```
### Size (required)
The number of rows the GUI should contain. Integer value between `1` and `6`.
```json
"size": 3
```
### Items (required)
A MAP of items to display. Each entry needs its unique string identifier. See the [Items](/skiesguis/gui_config/items/) page for more information.
```json
"items": {}
```
### Alias Commands
A list of commands that can be used to access this GUI. Each entry is a new command, which should only be one word and unused by another mod. **A restart is required to register commands**!
```json
"alias_commands": [
  "example"
]
```
### Alias Permission
The permission node required to use any of the [Alias Commands](#alias-commands). If undefined, the default `skiesguis.open.<gui_id>` permission will be used. Set to `""` to set no permission requirement.
```json
"alias_permission": "skiesguis.open.example"
```
### Open Actions
A list of Actions that are executed when the GUI is opened. Any [Open Requirements](#open-requirements) must succeed before any actions are executed. Each action can have [Requirements](/skiesguis/gui_config/requirements/) defined that must also succeed before each actions is executed. See [Actions](/skiesguis/gui_config/actions/) for more information.
```json
"open_actions": {
  "action_1": {
    "type": "COMMAND_CONSOLE",
    "click": "ANY",
    "commands": ["give %player% diamond 1"]
  },
  "action_2": {
    "type": "MESSAGE",
    "click": "ANY",
    "message": ["<blue>Thanks for opening my menu!"]
  }
}
```
### Close Actions
A list of Actions that are executed when the GUI is closed. Each action can have [Requirements](/skiesguis/gui_config/requirements/) defined that must also succeed before each actions is executed. See [Actions](/skiesguis/gui_config/actions/) for more information.
```json
"close_actions": {
  "action_1": {
    "type": "COMMAND_CONSOLE",
    "click": "ANY",
    "commands": ["give %player% diamond_sword 1"]
  },
  "action_2": {
    "type": "MESSAGE",
    "click": "ANY",
    "message": ["<red>Sad to see you go. Take this for the road!"]
  }
}
```
### Open Requirements
Define requirements that must be met before a GUI can be opened. Optionally, [Actions](/skiesguis/gui_config/actions/) can be defined to execute when the requirements have failed or succeeded. See [Requirements](/skiesguis/gui_config/requirements/) for more information on requirements.
```json
"view_requirements": {
  "requirements": {
    "example_requirement_1": {
      "type": "PERMISSION",
      "permission": "test.permission"
    }
  },
  "deny_actions": {
    "deny_action_1": {
      "type": "MESSAGE",
      "message": ["<red>You do not have permission!"]
    }
  },
  "success_actions": {
    "success_action_1": {
      "type": "MESSAGE",
      "message": ["<green>You do have permission!"]
    }
  }
},
```
