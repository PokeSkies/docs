import { FileTree } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import { LinkCard } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Each Crate configuration is stored in its own JSON file within the `crates` folder inside the main `/config/skiescrates/` folder.
<FileTree>
- config
    - skiescrates
        - crates
            - example_crate.json
            - second_crate.json
</FileTree>

Every Crate has a large amount of configuration options to customize the Crate.
```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "name": "<red>Example Crate",
  "display": {},
  "preview": "",
  "animation": "",
  "permission": "",
  "inventory_space": -1,
  "cost": {},
  "cooldown": -1,
  "failure": {},
  "keys": {},
  "block": {},
  "rewards": {}
}
```

## Enabled
Toggles whether the crate is enabled or disabled.
```json
"enabled": true
```
## Name (required)
The name of the crate used in many places, specifically the `%crate_name%` placeholder. Uses <a href="https://docs.advntr.dev/minimessage/format.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MiniMessage formatting</a>!
```json
"name": "<red>Example Crate"
```
## Display (required)
The item used to represent the Crate when given as an **inventory** item through the `/crate give` command. This is unrelated to the block.
```json
"display": {
  "item": "minecraft:chest",
  "name": "<red>Example Crate",
  "lore": [
    "<gray>Example Lore!"
  ]
}
```

## Preview
The ID of the preview menu to show when players preview the crate (left-click the crate block). Leave blank or remove for no preview menu. See [Previews](/skiescrates/previews/) for more information.
```json
"preview": "example_preview"
```
## Animation
The ID of the animation to use when the crate is opened. Leave blank or remove for no animation, which instantly opens the crate and gives a reward. See [Opening Animations](/skiescrates/openings/base/) for more information.
```json
"animation": "example_animation"
```
## Permission
The permission node required to open this crate. If undefined, no permission is required.
```json
"permission": "skiescrates.crate.example"
```
## Inventory Space
The minimum amount of free inventory slots a player must have to open this crate. Set to `-1` to disable.
```json
"inventory_space": 5
```
## Cost Options
Define the cost to open this crate. Remove or leave blank to disable costs.
```json
"cost": {
  "provider": "IMPACTOR",
  "currency": "impactor:dollars",
  "amount": 100
}
```

## Cooldown
The cooldown time in seconds between crate openings for each player. Set to `-1` to disable.
```json
"cooldown": 60
```
## Failure Options
Define what happens when a player fails to open the crate for some reason, like missing keys, insufficient funds, inventory space, etc.
```json
"failure": {
  "pushback": 0.5,
  "sound": {
    "sound": "minecraft:block.lava.extinguish",
    "pitch": 1.0,
    "volume": 0.5
  }
}
```

  "example_key": 1
}
```
