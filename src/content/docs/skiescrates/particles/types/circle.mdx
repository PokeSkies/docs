## Inherited
All Particle Effect Types inherit a base set of options. See [Particle Effect Options](/skiescrates/particles/particle_effects/#particle-effect-options) for more information.
## Radius
The radius of the circle.
```json
"radius": 1.0
```
## Points
The number of points to create around the circle.
```json
"points": 20
```
## Phase
The starting angle (in radians) around the circle.
```json
"phase": 0.0
```
## Clockwise
Whether the effect should progress clockwise (true) or counter-clockwise (false).
```json
"clockwise": true
```
## Strands
The number of strands to create around the circle. Each strand will be evenly spaced around the circle
```json
"strands": 1
```
## Rotation
The rotation of the entire circle effect around each axis (in degrees).
```json
"rotation": {
  "x": 0.0,
  "y": 0.0,
  "z": 0.0
