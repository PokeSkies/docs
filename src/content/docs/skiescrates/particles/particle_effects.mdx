import { LinkCard } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Particles Effects are predefined particle shapes that can be used within Particle Animations to create visual effects when a crate is opened. There are various settings that apply to all effects, as well as specific settings for each effect type.

```json
{
  "type": "",
  "particle": {
    "type": "minecraft:happy_villager"
  },
  "speed": 1,
  "start_delay": 0,
  "end_delay": 0,
  "offset": {
    "x": 0.0,
    "y": 1.0,
    "z": 0.0
  }
}
```

## Particle Effect Options
### Type
The type of particle effect to display. A list of available types can be found in [Particle Effect Types](#particle-effect-types).
```json
"type": "SPIRAL"
```
### Particle
The particle to use for this effect. This is in Minecraft's Particle Option formatting, which allows for various options depending on the particle type. All particles have a `"type"` option that defines the particle ID. Find additional options on the Minecraft Wiki's <a href="https://minecraft.wiki/w/Particle_format" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Particle format</a> page.
```json
"particle": {
  "type": "minecraft:happy_villager"
}
```
### Speed
The speed of this particle effects animation. A particle effect is made up of frames, one particle packet per frame. This speed setting controls how many ticks a single frame lasts. `1` means each frame lasts 1 tick (20 frames per second) where `2` means each frame lasts 2 ticks (10 frames per second). Defaults to `1` if not provided.
```json
"speed": 1
```
### Start Delay
The delay in ticks before this particle effect starts playing. Useful for sequencing multiple effects. Defaults to `0` if not provided.
```json
"start_delay": 0
```
### End Delay
The delay in ticks after this particle effect finishes playing before the next effect starts. Useful for sequencing multiple effects. Defaults to `0` if not provided.
```json
"end_delay": 0
```
### Offset
The offset position to apply to the particle effect. This is relative to the crate's bottom center position.
```json
"offset": {
  "x": 0.0,
  "y": 1.0,
  "z": 0.0
}
```
### Additional Options
Additional options are available depending on the type of animation used. See [Animation Types](#animation-types) for each type's additional options.

## Effect Types
These are the available Effect Types along with a short description.

| Identifier | Description                                                        |

| SPIRAL     | Spiral progressing around and down a cylinder                      |
| PULSE      | Growing 2D circles extending from a center point to an outer width |
