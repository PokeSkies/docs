World animations are in-world animations of the crate opening process. Everything is done through packets to allow multiple users to use a crate without conflicts. This section includes some complicated concepts that may be hard to understand, so please refer to the [Examples](#examples) section for pre-made animations that can be used as a base.

All world animations live in the `world` folder inside the `config/skiescrates/openings/` directory.
