Every crate in SkiesCrates can have a custom opening animation that plays when a player opens the crate. There are 3 main animations types available:
- **No Animation** - The crate instantly opens and gives a reward without any animation.
- **Inventory Animation** - A GUI-based animation that displays items in an inventory interface.
- **World Animation** - An animation that plays in the world at the crate's location using packets.

All animations live in the `opening` folder inside the `config/skiescrates/animations/` directory.
