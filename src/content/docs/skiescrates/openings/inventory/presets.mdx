Presets are reusable lists of items that can be used by Spinning Items. There are two types of presets, Rewards and Animations!
```json"presets": {
"presets": {
  "rewards": {
    "default": {}
  },
  "animations": {
    "example_blocks": [
      {
        "item": "minecraft:stone",
        "weight": 1,
        "nbt": {
          "minecraft:hide_tooltip": {}
        }
      },
      {
        "item": "minecraft:dirt",
        "weight": 1,
        "nbt": {
          "minecraft:hide_tooltip": {}
        }
      },
      {
        "item": "minecraft:cobblestone",
        "weight": 1,
        "nbt": {
          "minecraft:hide_tooltip": {}
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Reward Presets
Reward Presets are currently unused but are planned for future versions of SkiesCrates to allow you to selectively limit certain rewards in a given animation. For the time being, you can create an empty reward preset as shown below to avoid errors.
```json
"rewards": {
  "default": {}
}
```
## Animation Presets
Animation Presets are lists of items that can be referenced by Spinning Items in inventory animations. This is the core part of an animated item as a list of items must be provided to spin through. Each entry in a preset uses the same generic [Item Configuration](/skiescrates/items/item_options/) format, except an additional `"weight"` option is required to determine the likelihood of that item being selected for a spin.
```json
"animations": {
  "example_blocks": [
    {
      "item": "minecraft:stone",
      "weight": 1,
      "nbt": {
        "minecraft:hide_tooltip": {}
      }
    },
    {
      "item": "minecraft:dirt",
      "weight": 1,
      "nbt": {
        "minecraft:hide_tooltip": {}
      }
    },
    {
      "item": "minecraft:cobblestone",
      "weight": 1,
      "nbt": {
        "minecraft:hide_tooltip": {}
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
