title: Spinning Items
description: Guide to configuring spinning items in inventory opening animations
---

Spinning items, or spinners, are a key concept for inventory opening animations. They are the core component that makes the animation, animated! Spinners are the generic term for an item that changes through a series of items to create a spinning effect. These spinners though have additional options to control how they spin and when. These options make spinners very customizable, allowing you to create complex animation sequences.

Take a look this basic example of a spinner configuration. This spinner is an **Animated** spinner, meaning it has no impact on the final reward given to the player, nor does it affect when the crate should end. It is purely for visual effect.
```json
"animated": {
  "prize": {
    "preset": "default",
    "mode": "INDEPENDENT",
    "slots": [
      0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8,
      9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17,
      18, 19, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26
    ],
    "spin_count": 51,
    "spin_interval": 1,
    "start_delay": 0,
    "change_interval": 5,
    "change_amount": 1,
    "sound": {}
  }
}
```

This spinner defined here has a lot of options, but it's actually fairly simple. Read about each of the options below to understand what they do!
## Preset
The item preset to use for this spinner. This is the ID of a preset defined within the inventory animation's config file. The use case depends on the Spinner Type:
- **Reward** - This preset is mostly unused at this time, as the reward spinner uses the crate's rewards as the items to spin through.
- **Animated** - This preset defines the list of items that this spinner will cycle through while spinning.
```json
"preset": "default"
```
## Mode
The spinning mode for this spinner. This controls how the spinner will change the slots within this spinner. The following modes are available:
- **INDEPENDENT** - Each slot in this spinner changes to a random item.
- **SEQUENTIAL** - Each slot in this spinner changes in a sequence, one after another. This creates a rolling effect where each item in the list changes to the one in the previous slot and a new one is added to the start.
- **SYNCED** - Each slot in this spinner changes to the same item.
- **RANDOM** - Randomly changes the item in only a single slot.
```json
"mode": "INDEPENDENT"
```
## Slots
A list of slots that this spinner will control.
```json
"slots": [
  0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6,
  7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12
]
```
## Spin Count
The total number of spins this spinner will perform before stopping.
```json
"spin_count": 51
```
## Spin Interval
The **starting** interval, in ticks, between each spin of this spinner.
```json
"spin_interval": 1
```
## Start Delay
The delay, in ticks, before this spinner starts spinning from the start of the animation.
```json
"start_delay": 0
```
## Change Interval
The number of ticks before increase the [Spin Interval](#spin-interval) by the [Change Amount](#change-amount), in a loop.
```json
"change_interval": 5
```
## Change Amount
The amount, in ticks, to increase the [Spin Interval](#spin-interval) by every [Change Interval](#change-interval).
```json
"change_amount": 1
```
## Sound
The sound to play every time this spinner spins.
```json
"sound": {
  "sound": "minecraft:block.note_block.xylophone",
  "pitch": 0.5,
  "volume": 0.5
}
```
