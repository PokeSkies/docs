Buttons are special items that perform actions when clicked. There are four types of buttons available: Reward, Page Next, Page Previous, and Close.
```json
"buttons": {
    "reward": {},
    "page_next": {},
    "page_previous": {},
    "close": {}
}
```
## Reward Button
Used to define where rewards are displayed and what their name and lore is. The item used is pulled from the reward's display setting. If a reward has a [Preview](/skiescrates/rewards/rewards/#preview) display defined, that is used instead.
```json
"reward": {
  "slots": [
    10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,
    19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25,
    28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34,
    37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43
  ],
  "name": "%reward_name%",
  "lore": [
    "<gray>Example Lore!",
    "<gray>Weight: <white>%reward_weight%",
    "<gray>Chance: <white>%reward_percent%"
  ]
}
```
## Page Next Button
Used to navigate to the next page of rewards in the preview menu, if available.
```json
"page_next": {
  "slots": [53],
  "item": "minecraft:arrow",
  "name": "<green>Next Page",
  "lore": [
      "<gray>Click to view next page"
  ]
}
```
<LinkCard

/>

## Page Previous Button
Used to navigate to the previous page of rewards in the preview menu, if available.
```json
"page_previous": {
  "slots": [45],
  "item": "minecraft:arrow",
  "name": "<green>Previous Page",
  "lore": [
      "<gray>Click to view previous page"
  ]
}
