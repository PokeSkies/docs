Previews are how players can view the potential rewards of a crate before opening it. They are defined generically, meaning any crate can use any preview, simply refer to the Preview's id in the crate's [Preview](/skiescrates/crates/crates/#preview) option. Previews are paginated to allow for large numbers of rewards to be displayed.

All Previews live in the `previews` folder inside the `config/skiescrates/` directory.

## Rewards
Used to define where rewards are displayed and what their name and lore is. The item used is pulled from the reward's display setting. If a reward has a [Preview](/skiescrates/rewards/rewards/#preview) display defined, that is used instead.
```json
"rewards": {
  "slots": [
    10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,
    19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25,
    28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34,
    37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43
  ],
  "name": "%reward_name%",
  "lore": [
    "<gray>Example Lore!",
    "<gray>Weight: <white>%reward_weight%",
    "<gray>Chance: <white>%reward_percent%"
  ]
}
```
## Items
A map list of additional items to display in the menu. These are typically used for background or decorative items. Supports Actions, including Pagination related Actions.
```json
"items": {
  "background": {
    "item": "minecraft:black_stained_glass_pane",
    "slots": [
      0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
