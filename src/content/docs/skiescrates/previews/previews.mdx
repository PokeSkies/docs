Previews are how players can view the potential rewards of a crate before opening it. They are defined generically, meaning any crate can use any preview, simply refer to the Preview's id in the crate's [Preview](/skiescrates/crates/crates/#preview) option. Previews are paginated to allow for large numbers of rewards to be displayed.

All Previews live in the `previews` folder inside the `config/skiescrates/` directory.
