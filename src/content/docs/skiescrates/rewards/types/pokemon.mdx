import { LinkCard } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Gives an item to the player. If display is left empty, the `"item"` option will be used as the display item.
```json
"example_reward": {
  "type": "POKEMON",
  "name": "<aqua>Pokemon Reward",
  "weight": 1,
  "pokemon": {
    "species": "cobblemon:rayquaza",
    "form": "",
    "aspects": [],
    "level": 100,
    "shiny": true
  }
}
```
## Inherited
All Reward Types inherit a base set of reward options. See [Reward Options](/skiescrates/rewards/#reward-options) for more information.
## Pokemon (required)
The Pokemon to give to the player when this reward is selected.
```json
"pokemon": {
  "species": "cobblemon:rayquaza",
  "form": "",
  "aspects": [],
  "level": 100,
  "shiny": true
}
```
### Species (required)
The species of the Pokemon to give. Must be a valid Cobblemon species ID in the format `modid:species_name`. Set to `random` to give a random species (must set the Reward's `"display"` or it will fallback).
```json
"species": "cobblemon:rayquaza"
```
### Form
The ID of the form to set the Pokemon as. Must be a valid form ID for the selected species. Leave blank or remove to use the default form.
```json
"form": "altered"
```
### Aspects
A list of aspects to apply to the Pokemon. Uses the same formatting as Cobblemon's `/pokegive` command. Leave blank or remove to apply no aspects.
```json
"aspects": [
  "ability=adaptability"
]
```
### Level
The level to set the Pokemon to. Supports both an integer value (whole number) or a object containing `"min"` and `"max"` values for a random level within the range.
```json
"level": 100
```
```json
"level": {
  "min": 50,
  "max": 100
}
```
### Shiny
Set if the Pokemon is given as shiny. Supports either a boolean value (`true` or `false`) or a percentage chance between `0.0` and `1.0`. If a chance is used, the display/preview of the Pokemon will **not** be shiny.
```json
"shiny": true
```
```json
"shiny": 0.05 // 5% chance to be shiny
```
