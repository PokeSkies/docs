This page describes configuring an item in JSON config formatting and the available options for them.
## Item Options
The item definitions themselves are also in a MAP format (key -> value), containing all the available options for the item. Below are the available options for items.
### Item (required)
An item resource location (combination of `mod_id:item_id`). This can be any item, vanilla or modded. Unknown item stacks will default to `minecraft:air`. See the [Supported Items](#supported-items) section for more information on supported items.
```json
"item": "minecraft:stone"
```
### Slots
> Aliases: `slot`

:::warning
This option is not always available depending on the context of the item. For example, in a Reward's `"display": {}` configuration, the slots setting is not available.
:::

A list of slots that this item will be inserted into. This value should be between `0` and the (`size` * 9) - 1. EX: if `"size: 3"`, then between `0` and `26`. Defaults to an empty list if not provided.
:::tip
Some options are flexible-lists, meaning you can either set it to a specific value or define a list!
> `"slots": 1`<br></br>
> `"slots": [1, 2, 3]`
:::
```json
"slots": [0, 1, 7, 8]
```
### Amount
The amount of this item that should be displayed in each slot. Defaults to 1 if not provided.
```json
"amount": 10
```
### Name
The name to override the item with. Defaults to the item's normal name if not provided. Uses <a href="https://docs.advntr.dev/minimessage/format.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MiniMessage formatting</a>!
```json
"name": "<red>Example Stone"
```
### Lore
A list of lore to override the item with. Defaults to an empty list if not provided. Uses <a href="https://docs.advntr.dev/minimessage/format.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MiniMessage formatting</a>!
```json
"lore": [
  "<gray>Example Line 1",
  "<gray>Example Line 2"
]
```
### Custom Model Data
An number representing the Custom Model Data of the item. This is a quick option for the `"minecraft:custom_model_data"` component, added for ease of use. Not applied if not provided.
```json
"custom_model_data": 123456
```
### Components (nbt)
> Aliases: `nbt`

A list of components that are set onto the item. This follows the same formatting as applying components to an item via `/give`. No additional components are applied if not provided.
:::note
Components are the new way of defining item NBT in Minecraft. They replaced the older NBT format in versions 1.20.5+. For more information on components, see the <a href="https://minecraft.wiki/w/Data_component_format" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Minecraft Wiki on Data Components</a>.
:::
```json
"components": {
  "minecraft:enchantments": {
    "levels": {
    "minecraft:unbreaking": 3
    },
    "show_in_tooltip": false
  },
  "minecraft:hide_additional_tooltip": {}
}
```

### Actions
:::warning
This option is not always available depending on the context of the item. For example, in a Reward's `"display": {}` configuration, the actions setting is not available, but it is for the `"items"` section of a Preview GUI.
:::
A list of Actions that are executed when the item is clicked on. See [Actions](/skiescrates/items/actions/) for more information.
```json
"actions": {
  "action_1": {
    "type": "COMMAND_CONSOLE",
    "click": "ANY",
    "commands": ["give %player% diamond_sword 1"]
  },
  "action_2": {
    "type": "MESSAGE",
    "click": "ANY",
    "message": ["<blue>You have received the Example Sword!"]
  }
}
```

## Supported Items
The `"item": ""` option supports a variety of inputs, either default `mod_id:item_id` identifiers or special keywords for specific item types. All inputs are parsed against any Placeholder Services.
### Vanilla Items
Vanilla items can be called on using either `minecraft:<item_id>` or just `<item_id>`. For example, both `minecraft:stone` and `stone` will give a stone block.
### Modded Items
Modded items can be called on using their full `mod_id:item_id` identifier. For example, `cobblemon:poke_ball` will give a Poke Ball item from Cobblemon.
### Player Heads
Player Heads can be set using the special keyword `playerhead` followed by an option specifier. Below are available option specifiers:
- `playerhead` - Gives the head of the player viewing the GUI.
- `playerhead-<uuid>` - Gives the head of the player with the specified UUID. This will work if the player is offline but must have played on the server before.
- `playerhead-<username>` - Gives the head of the player with the specified username. This will only work if the player is online.
- `playerhead-<base64>` - Gives a custom head with the texture specified by the base64 string. Useful for custom heads from head databases.
